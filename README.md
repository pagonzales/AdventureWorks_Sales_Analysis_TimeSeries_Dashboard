# AdventureWorks_Sales_Analysis_TimeSeries_Dashboard
I have created a sales analysis time series using MS excel. This includes the use of power query (cleaning, extracting, transforming, loading data), power pivot relation and data modelling, DAX for calculations and measures, excel functions (includes but not limited to xlookup, vlookup, index match, nested functions), and virtual storytelling.
